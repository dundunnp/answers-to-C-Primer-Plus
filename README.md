# answers-to-C-Primer-Plus

**Introduction:**

I am a sophomore in college, learning C++ through C++ Primer Plus 6th edition, and share the programming exercises corresponding to each chapter in the learning process (now updated to chapter 13), if there are any errors or improvements, please contact me, thanks!



**Document Description:**

  Since the first nine chapters of exercises do not require more than one file to write (except for the two questions in Chapter 9), it is straightforward to use a cpp file to include all the exercises in a chapter, and name it with a file name similar to chapter x exercises. 
  For the later chapters, which require more than one file, I use a file name similar to cxx_xx to name each subtopic, where the front xx indicates the chapter number and the back xx indicates the question number.
  You can download the file and run it directly.
